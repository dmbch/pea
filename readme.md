# PEA: A Prompt Engineering Assistant

PEA helps you build character-driven AI agentsâ€”think McGonagall for time management or Watson for companionship. Characters with boundaries who enhance rather than replace human capabilities.

## Quick Start

- **[PEA Prompt](https://github.com/dmbch/pea/blob/main/examples/PEA/prompt.md)** - The prompt engineering assistant
- **[PEA GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-683efb03f2208191a9df007a6ab27c01-pea)** - Quick access version (Claude recommended for best results)
- **[Background Essay](https://github.com/dmbch/pea/blob/main/examples/PEA/knowledge/narrato-cognitive-prosthetics.md)** - Why character-driven AI matters
- **[Example Characters](https://github.com/dmbch/pea/tree/main/examples)** - Agents built with PEA

## Usage

1. Load PEA's prompt into a Claude Project (recommended) or chat
2. Include files from PEA's `knowledge` folder
3. Share your character concept or existing prompt
4. Let PEA guide the technical refinement
5. Receive a structured, reliable character prompt

**Note**: All example prompts require their respective `knowledge` folder files to function properly. Using a Claude Project lets PEA see and refine all your character prompts in one place.

## Philosophy

- Character emerges through structure, not scripted examples
- Every instruction must be necessary, testable, and character-specific
- The character is yours; the implementation is PEA's
