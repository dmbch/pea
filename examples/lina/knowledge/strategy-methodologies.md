## Part I: Big 3 Consulting Firm Methodologies

### McKinsey & Company Methodologies

#### 1. GE-McKinsey Matrix (Nine-Box Matrix)

**What it is and how it works:** Developed by McKinsey for General Electric in the 1970s, this strategic portfolio management tool plots business units on a 3x3 grid based on Industry Attractiveness (vertical axis) and Competitive Strength (horizontal axis). Unlike the BCG Matrix which uses only market growth and market share, this framework incorporates multiple weighted factors. Industry attractiveness includes market size, growth rate, competitive intensity, regulatory environment, and profit margins. Business strength factors include market share, brand strength, distribution channels, cost position, and technological capabilities. The matrix produces nine possible positions with recommendations ranging from "invest and grow" (high-high quadrant) to "harvest or divest" (low-low quadrant).

**When to use it:** Best applied when managing diverse portfolios of business units or products, particularly in large corporations needing resource allocation decisions. Ideal when simple market share and growth metrics are insufficient due to complex industry dynamics. Most effective for multi-business companies requiring strategic clarity about investment priorities.

**Key benefits and limitations:**
- Benefits: More comprehensive than BCG Matrix; provides nuanced strategic guidance; identifies strategic priorities across complex portfolios; considers both external and internal factors
- Limitations: Requires significant data collection; subjective weighting of factors can introduce bias; may be overly complex for simpler decisions; time-intensive to execute properly

**Sector applications:** Widely used across technology (Google's Alphabet portfolio), consumer goods (P&G's brand portfolio), energy (ExxonMobil's business units), and manufacturing (General Electric's original application).

**Developer:** McKinsey & Company in partnership with General Electric, 1970s

#### 2. Three Horizons of Growth Model

**What it is and how it works:** This strategic planning framework helps organizations balance short-term performance with long-term growth by categorizing initiatives across three time horizons. Horizon 1 (0-3 years) focuses on defending and extending core businesses through incremental improvements. Horizon 2 (2-5 years) involves emerging opportunities that build on existing capabilities but extend into new markets. Horizon 3 (5-12 years) represents transformational opportunities—entirely new businesses or breakthrough innovations. The framework emphasizes managing all three horizons simultaneously with different resource allocations, success metrics, and management approaches for each.

**When to use it:** Essential for organizations seeking sustainable growth, particularly those facing market maturity in core businesses. Critical during strategic planning cycles, innovation pipeline development, or when establishing venture capital arms.

**Key benefits and limitations:**
- Benefits: Provides balanced approach to growth; prevents over-focus on either short-term or long-term; creates common language for different investments; helps align resources with time horizons
- Limitations: Can lead to compartmentalization; resource allocation decisions can be politically charged; Horizon 3 investments often fail; may not account for rapid industry disruption

**Sector applications:** Technology companies like Amazon (AWS as Horizon 2, drone delivery as Horizon 3), pharmaceuticals (drug pipeline management), automotive (traditional vehicles, hybrids, autonomous vehicles).

**Developer:** McKinsey partners Mehrdad Baghai, Stephen Coley, and David White, "The Alchemy of Growth" (1999)

#### 3. Business System Framework

**What it is and how it works:** This framework analyzes competitive advantage by examining interconnected activities that create value for customers. It maps the entire business system from supplier relationships through customer delivery, identifying where competitive advantages can be built and sustained. The framework views business as a system of interdependent activities rather than isolated functions, emphasizing that sustainable advantage requires barriers to imitation across multiple system elements.

**When to use it:** Most effective for strategy development and competitive positioning analysis. Valuable when companies need to understand competitive advantage sources, identify improvement opportunities, or design business model innovations.

**Key benefits and limitations:**
- Benefits: Provides holistic view of competitive advantage; identifies interconnections between activities; helps pinpoint specific advantage sources; guides improvement prioritization
- Limitations: Can be complex to map comprehensively; may be difficult to quantify advantage sources; requires deep understanding of business operations

**Sector applications:** Successfully applied across manufacturing (Toyota's production system), retail (Walmart's logistics system), airlines (Southwest's low-cost model), and technology (Apple's integrated ecosystem).

**Developer:** McKinsey & Company, popularized in the 1980s and 1990s

### Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Methodologies

#### 4. Strategy Palette Framework

**What it is and how it works:** This framework recognizes that different business environments require different strategic approaches. It uses three dimensions—Predictability, Malleability, and Harshness—to categorize environments. Based on these dimensions, five strategic approaches emerge: Classical (predictable, non-malleable environments), Adaptive (unpredictable, non-malleable), Visionary (predictable, malleable), Shaping (unpredictable, malleable), and Renewal (harsh environments). Each approach has specific tools, success factors, and organizational requirements.

**When to use it:** Essential for strategic planning in complex, multi-business organizations. Most valuable when companies operate in diverse environments or are entering new markets with different dynamics.

**Key benefits and limitations:**
- Benefits: Provides contingent approach to strategy; recognizes environmental diversity; offers specific tools for each approach; helps align strategy with context
- Limitations: Can be complex to apply across multiple businesses; environmental assessment can be subjective; may oversimplify strategic choices

**Sector applications:** Technology companies (Google's different approaches across search, cloud, and emerging technologies), pharmaceuticals (established drugs vs. research), energy companies (mature oil business vs. renewable ventures).

**Developer:** Martin Reeves, Knut Haanaes, and Janmejaya Sinha at BCG, "Your Strategy Needs a Strategy" (2015)

#### 5. Experience Curve

**What it is and how it works:** This fundamental BCG concept demonstrates that unit costs decline by a consistent percentage each time cumulative production doubles, typically 10-25% with 20% being common. Cost reduction comes from learning effects, scale effects, and technological improvements. The curve implies that market share leadership creates cost advantages through faster experience accumulation.

**When to use it:** Most valuable in manufacturing-intensive industries with standardized products. Critical during early stages of product or industry development when experience advantages can be established.

**Key benefits and limitations:**
- Benefits: Provides quantitative basis for cost reduction; supports market share strategies; helps predict competitive dynamics; guides pricing decisions
- Limitations: Assumes stable technology; may not apply to service industries; can be disrupted by innovation; encourages commodity thinking

**Sector applications:** Successfully applied in semiconductors, automotive manufacturing, chemicals, steel production, and consumer electronics.

**Developer:** Bruce Henderson and BCG in the 1960s

### Bain & Company Methodologies

#### 6. Net Promoter System (NPS)

**What it is and how it works:** This customer loyalty framework centers on one question: "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend us to a friend or colleague?" Customers are categorized as Promoters (9-10), Passives (7-8), or Detractors (0-6). NPS equals percentage of Promoters minus percentage of Detractors. However, NPS is more than a metric—it's a management philosophy including closed-loop feedback processes and organizational alignment around customer advocacy.

**When to use it:** Essential for customer-centric organizations across all industries. Most valuable for companies with direct customer relationships, subscription models, or high customer lifetime value.

**Key benefits and limitations:**
- Benefits: Simple to understand and implement; links customer loyalty to financial performance; creates customer-focused culture; enables benchmarking
- Limitations: Can be gamed; oversimplifies complex relationships; cultural bias in rating patterns; doesn't explain "why" behind scores

**Sector applications:** Widely adopted across financial services (Charles Schwab), technology (Apple, Google), retail (Costco, Amazon), and airlines (Southwest).

**Developer:** Fred Reichheld at Bain & Company, Harvard Business Review (2003)

#### 7. Results Delivery Framework

**What it is and how it works:** This methodology focuses on translating strategy into measurable business results through disciplined execution. Key components include setting clear success metrics upfront, establishing regular review cycles, creating feedback loops for course correction, and maintaining accountability throughout implementation. The approach recognizes that strategy execution often fails due to unclear metrics or inability to adapt.

**When to use it:** Essential for large-scale transformation programs, post-merger integrations, or any strategic initiative where execution risk is high.

**Key benefits and limitations:**
- Benefits: Improves execution success rates; provides clear accountability; enables rapid course correction; links strategy to measurable outcomes
- Limitations: Can be resource-intensive; may slow initial implementation; requires cultural change toward measurement
