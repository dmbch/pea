# Strategic Presentation Techniques Dossier: From Boardroom to Hallway

## Executive Overview

This comprehensive dossier provides a full spectrum of presentation techniques for strategic business contexts, ranging from formal consulting frameworks to agile approaches. Drawing from extensive research on [top consulting firms](https://www.theanalystacademy.com/consulting-presentations/) ([McKinsey, BCG, Bain](https://www.jeffsu.org/presentation-techniques-from-mckinsey-bain-and-bcg/)), tech companies, and modern communication experts, this guide equips you with tools for every presentation scenario—from impromptu hallway conversations to critical board presentations.

-----

## Part 1: Foundational Principles

### 1. Audience-First Thinking

**Definition**: The practice of [analyzing and adapting presentations](https://www.comm.pitt.edu/oral-comm-lab/audience-analysis) to match your audience’s interests, knowledge level, and decision-making style.

**Why It Matters**:

- Ensures content directly addresses [audience concerns](https://open.maricopa.edu/com225/chapter/need-to-find-audience-analysis-reading/)
- Increases retention by speaking to specific interests
- Aligns messaging with audience values and processes
- Demonstrates respect for audience expertise level

**Implementation**:

- Conduct pre-presentation stakeholder interviews
- Research audience demographics and decision-making authority
- Customize examples relevant to their industry/role
- Address potential objections proactively

**Common Mistakes**: Assuming knowledge levels, using unexplained jargon, focusing on features instead of benefits

### 2. The “So What?” Test

**Core Concept**: [Question the relevance](https://benjaminball.com/blog/the-so-what-test/) of every piece of content by asking “So what?” from the audience’s perspective.

**Application**:

- After each slide, ask: “Why should my audience care?”
- Connect every data point to business implications
- Ensure every slide advances the overall argument
- Remove information that doesn’t pass the test

**Example**: Instead of “Market size is $10B,” say “Market size of $10B means capturing just 5% would double our revenue”

### 3. Cognitive Load Management

**Foundation**: Based on [Miller’s Law (7±2 rule)](https://blog.uxtweak.com/millers-law/) and [cognitive load theory](https://lawsofux.com/cognitive-load/), structure information to optimize working memory capacity.

**Key Techniques**:

- **Chunking**: Group related information into 5-7 item units
- **One Message Per Slide**: Limit each slide to single key insight
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build to complex ideas
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Use consistent layouts and white space

### 4. The Curse of Knowledge

**Challenge**: [Experts unconsciously assume](https://www.aje.com/arc/how-to-overcome-the-curse-of-knowledge/) others share their background knowledge.

**Solutions**:

- Start with basics even if they seem obvious
- Define all acronyms and technical terms
- Use analogies to connect new concepts to familiar experiences
- Check for understanding with [regular pauses](https://knowledgeenthusiast.com/2024/11/19/curse-of-knowledge/)

### 5. Aristotle’s Rhetorical Triangle

**[Three Elements](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/businesswriting/chapter/the-rhetorical-triangle-ethos-pathos-and-logos/)**:

- **Ethos (Credibility)**: Establish expertise and trustworthiness
- **Pathos (Emotion)**: Create emotional connection and urgency
- **Logos (Logic)**: Provide data-driven arguments and evidence

**Strategic Integration**: Balance all three elements based on audience preferences and decision-making styles.

### 6. Progressive Disclosure

**Principle**: [Reveal information gradually](https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/using-progressive-disclosure-complex-content/), showing only what’s needed at each stage.

**Implementation**:

- Start with executive summary
- Layer supporting details in appendix
- Create modular sections for flexible depth
- Prepare backup slides for anticipated questions

### 7. Start with Why vs. Start with Answer

**Start with Why** (Simon Sinek):

- Best for: Vision-setting, change management, inspiration
- Structure: Purpose → Process → Product

**Start with Answer** ([Consulting approach](https://www.theanalystacademy.com/powerpoint-storytelling/)):

- Best for: Executive briefings, analytical recommendations
- Structure: Conclusion → Supporting arguments → Evidence

1. Ask (specific next step)

### 5. The Twitter Test

**Process**: Distill complex ideas into 280 characters or less

- Forces extreme clarity

## Diagnostic Tool: Selecting the Right Presentation Approach

### Step 1: Assess Your Context

**Audience Size:**

- [ ] 1-5 people → Consider informal/conversational
- [ ] 6-20 people → Hybrid approach works well
- [ ] 20+ people → Formal structure recommended

**Stakes Level:**

- [ ] High (board, investors) → Formal frameworks (SCQA, Pyramid)
- [ ] Medium (team leads) → Flexible approaches
- [ ] Low (colleagues) → Lightweight methods

**Time Constraints:**

- [ ] < 5 minutes → BLUF, PREP, or Elevator Pitch
- [ ] 5-20 minutes → SCR, One-Pager, 10/20/30
- [ ] 20+ minutes → Full frameworks with detail

### Step 2: Define Your Objective

**Primary Goal:**

- [ ] Inform → Pyramid Principle, MECE
- [ ] Persuade → PAS, SCQA
- [ ] Inspire → Hero’s Journey, Start with Why
- [ ] Collaborate → Stand-up, modular approaches

### Step 3: Match Approach to Situation

Based on your selections above, use this formula:

- **High stakes + Limited time** = BLUF or Executive Summary
- **Low stakes + Collaborative** = Stand-up or Napkin Pitch
- **Persuasion needed + Time available** = Full SCQA or PAS
- **Complex analysis + Expert audience** = Pyramid Principle

### Step 4: Prepare for Adaptability

Always prepare:

1. **Accordion versions** (1-min, 5-min, full)
1. **Backup approaches** if initial choice isn’t working
1. **Recovery techniques** for disruptions
1. **Modular content** for flexible delivery
